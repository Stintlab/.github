# 🏁 Welcome to StintLab

**StintLab** is a collaborative effort to create powerful, open-source tools for **motorsport event strategy and team management**, with a strong focus on the world of **E-Sports racing**.

In fast-paced racing environments, knowing how your strategy evolves—and how to adapt in real time—is everything. Our goal is to build software that helps teams make better decisions, faster.

## 💡 What We’re Working On

We're currently building a modular web-based platform consisting of:

- **StintLab** — the frontend application and user interface
- **Centrifuge** — the backend service that powers our logic and data handling

These tools are being developed with modern tech stacks:
- **Frontend**: Angular, PrimeNG, RxJS  
- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Project Reactor, MongoDB

Our long-term vision is to provide a **SaaS solution**, while also offering the freedom for teams to **self-host and customize** the platform to fit their specific needs.

## 🙌 Join the Journey

StintLab is still in its early phases, and there's lots of room to grow.  
Whether you're a developer, tester, strategist, or just someone with big ideas, we’d love to have you with us.
